# CryptoTetes ERC20 Token

## Compilation
Use Truffle to compile the contracts in [the contracts folder](./contracts):
```
npx truffle compile
```
This will output the compiled packages in the `./build` folder.

Beware of the Solidity compiler version that you are using.
Check the Truffle solidity compiler version with:
```
npx truffle version
```
Set the correct Solidity compiler version if needed in the [Truffle configuration](./truffle-config.js).
